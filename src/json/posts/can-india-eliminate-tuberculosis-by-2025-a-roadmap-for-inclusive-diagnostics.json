    "description": "<p>In a large country like India with a population of more than 1.4 billion, access to quality healthcare continues to pose an enormous challenge for the masses.&nbsp;</p><p>The paucity of &nbsp;hospital beds, lack of paramedical staff, &nbsp;broken supply chains, dearth of trained epidemiologists, and shortage of medical supplies during the Covid-19 crisis exposed our grossly inadequate public healthcare systems like never before. On the flip side, however, it also resulted in some breakthrough medical interventions. Under normal circumstances, vaccine development would usually take anywhere between 10-15 years, but India was swift to respond to the situation and scaled up its efforts by developing covid vaccines in less than a year, highlighting the ability of our healthcare community to achieve impossible targets through integration and collaboration.</p><p>While we found ourselves in dire straits due to the rampant spread of the novel coronavirus, the pandemic has derailed us from the path to fight many other diseases that could impair our healthcare systems, if not addressed in due time.</p><p>Tuberculosis, a bacterial infectious disease that directly affects the lungs, has been a subject of concern worldwide and affects millions of people across the country. India reports an alarming chunk of about 3 million TB cases every year, with a mortality number of almost half a million in 2019. In 2020, India alone accounted for 26% of the TB cases across the globe. In addition to this, there are more than a million &lsquo;missing&rsquo; cases every year that go unreported because they largely remain undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed. The Global Tuberculosis Report published by the World Health Organization (WHO) &nbsp;in October 2021, revealed that the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on our healthcare systems had &lsquo;reversed years of progress in providing essential TB services and reducing TB disease burden.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2017-2025 formulated by the Govt. of India, is a flagship public health initiative built on the success and learnings of the last NSP and serves as a comprehensive framework for all the stakeholders who are working towards eliminating TB from India. The plan proposes the adoption of bold strategies coupled with the availability of resources to realize its vision of a &lsquo;TB free India&rsquo; by 2030, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p><p>While India has been making consistent efforts to ramp up its services by treating more than 10 million TB patients under RNTCP, we are far from meeting the 2030 SDGs and 2035 End TB targets. Inadequate diagnosis and treatment, outdated and ineffective diagnostic tools like sputum-smear microscopy, and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) which account for about 1% of new TB cases; continue to be some of the major challenges in controlling the spread of TB. &nbsp;In addition to this, regulating and monitoring the spread of TB is a Herculean task in a densely populated country such as ours, and the ongoing pandemic has further aggravated the situation by diverting the majority of our healthcare staff and diagnostic services towards Covid management.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent research indicates that 75% of MDR TB cases globally were not treated accurately and contributed to active transmission of MDR TB in the community (Farhat et al 2019). In some sense, as the world is effectively treating drug susceptible forms of TB, the community transmission of drug resistant forms can snowball into a difficult to treat epidemic.&nbsp;</p><p>This poses a crucial question before us: How can we effectively combat the spread of tuberculosis and mitigate the damage caused to our healthcare systems? Although prior techniques have had limited impact in controlling the spread, comprehensively-deployed interventions based on the four strategic pillars of the &lsquo;Detect-Treat-Prevent-Build&rsquo; (DTPB) model can allow us to design and to bring about a rapid transformation in the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.</p><h3><strong>A case for Whole Genome Sequencing&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>For several years, clinical microbiology heavily relied on the use of conventional phenotypic and genotypic methods for the identification and treatment of infections. Not only are these methods extremely time consuming and expensive, the lack of technological infrastructure has also prevented us from distinguishing highly genetically related strains. The need of the hour is to build solutions that are affordable and accessible and can revolutionize TB diagnostics while facilitating personalized drug therapy by employing a decentralized approach to diagnosis and treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a technique that allows us to determine the entirety of an organism&rsquo;s DNA in a cost-effective way through a single comprehensive test. The use of WGS technology for the diagnosis of tuberculosis has been gaining traction across the world as it enables an &lsquo;all-in-one&rsquo; approach by providing epidemiological data and comprehensive information on genetic background and expected sensitivity of the strains.</p><p>While the use of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) for the treatment of tuberculosis has been deployed in countries such as the UK, Spain, &amp; Italy, there have been little efforts to expand the scope for this approach in India where we have merely laid the groundwork for its use.</p><p>Given the tremendous success of WGS based prediction of drug resistance in a single step, national programs must consider a change in strategy, moving away from sequential in vitro diagnostics, to large scale comprehensive screening using WGS.&nbsp;</p><p>These platforms are &nbsp;cost effective and can provide unprecedented asset utilization, wherein each installation can perform &gt;600,000 tests per year. Tentatively, 10 such installations can effectively cover the entire estimated TB caseload of India, at a cost comparable to current CBNAAT tests. Consequently, only a very small select number of cases will need culture DST to resolve outcome based discrepancies.&nbsp;</p><p>The expansion of genome sequencing based tests in India, which are extremely cost effective and provide comprehensive information in a quick turnaround time of less than 12 days, will enable us to combat diagnostic inaccuracies and delays that impede appropriate drug administration. By investing in sequencing technologies and ramping up the infrastructure and expertise for &nbsp;genome based tests, we can create a unique opportunity by establishing it as the gold standard in TB diagnostics and provide accessible healthcare to the masses; an attempt to truly revolutionize and re-envision the future of healthcare in our country as we strive to achieve our 2025 end TB targets.<br />&nbsp;</p>",
