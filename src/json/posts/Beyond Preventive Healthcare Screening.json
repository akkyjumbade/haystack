That simply mandates that we shift from the reactive to a proactive framework.  Preventive healthcare screening is the first step in that direction. The preventive screening tests often bring to fore an underlying issue whose symptoms have not yet manifested, so it results in early detection, reduced healthcare costs, and treatment outcomes, and longevity. Almost 70% of the healthcare decisions are based on preventive screening, followed by diagnostic testing.</p><p>Most preventive tests include evaluating the blood parameters which can identify organ specific aberrations (e.g cholesterol levels, hemoglobin levels, liver enzymes, thyroid hormone levels, etc), additionally can also involve other screening methods like X-rays, mammograms, vision and hearing tests. The tests are also tailored to address the needs of various age-groups and demographics. The results of the preventive screening tests help clinicians/health-care providers to suggest specific recommendations for lifestyle modification and/or therapeutic interventions.  </p><p>Though preventive screening healthcare tests help to a large extent, we need to go one level higher if we are to be truly proactive, we need to evaluate our inherent risks based on genetic screening. Since we not only inherit the genetic material from our parents but along with it the risks of our family and previous generations. We know for a fact that the risks of several diseases such as heart ailments, hypertension, diabetes runs in families. Genetic healthcare screening provides valuable insights into an individual's genetic risk profile, enabling personalized healthcare interventions. By integrating preventive healthcare screening with genetic screening, individuals can benefit from a comprehensive approach to health management. This synergy allows for the development of personalized healthcare plans tailored to an individual's genetic predispositions and lifestyle factors. </p><p>The genetic screening tests are truly predictive and personalized in nature. They can help identify predictive and predispositional testing (e.g risk of diabetes, risk of cancers), intolerances (gluten, lactose etc), sensitivities (caffeine), genetic risk for deficiencies (Vitamins, minerals), response to macronutrients.  Genetic screening tests can also help to know if you are a carrier for certain disorders which has implications for reproductive choices and decisions, identify about the variations in an individual’s DNA which influence how you will metabolize the specific drugs. </p><p>In conclusion the future of healthcare lies in and precision health initiatives. Preventive healthcare screening and genetic screening are powerful tools for promoting long-term health and well-being. By integrating genetic insights into healthcare decisions, individuals can take proactive steps to prevent disease and optimize their quality of life. Remember, your health is your most valuable asset—invest in it wisely.</p>",
