    "excerpt": "We all aspire to optimal health, which is the most critical aspect not just to achieve our aspirations and goals but also to have a quality of life. That simply mandates that we shift from the reactive to a proactive framework.  Preventive healthcare screening is the first step in that direction. The preventive screening tests often bring to fore an underlying issue whose symptoms have not yet manifested, so it results in early detection, reduced healthcare costs, and treatment outcomes, and longevity. Almost 70% of the healthcare decisions are based on preventive screening, followed by diagnostic testing",
    "description": "<p>Genomic evaluation of clinical samples and microbiomes have improved our understanding of the role of pathogens in clinical microbiology. Being highly sensitive, next generation sequencing (NGS) is the gold standard in pathogen identification and can overcome several limitations of current day diagnostics (1). A genomics-based approach for pathogen detection has the potential to be a one-test solution to identify several pathogens simultaneously. The utility of implementing genomics in infectious disease and particularly in critically ill patients has been explored but challenges remain (2). A diagnostic solution for the detection of pathogens needs to consider:<ol><li>Turnaround-time (TAT)</li><li>Cost</li><li>Comprehensivity</li></ol></p><p>A workflow that combined target enrichment, long-read sequencing and automated bioinformatics (Figure 1) could address these challenges and was demonstrated to simultaneously identify bacteria, fungi and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This strategy could overcome the issues associated with host background DNA and error rates of long read sequencing to provide accurate detection of pathogens. When tested across standard organisms, clinical isolates and blood samples from patients with suspected bloodstream infections this workflow could successfully and reproducibly identify the relevant pathogen and ARG. A blinded comparison of various clinical isolates revealed a concordance of 0.83 at species level and 0.90 at the genus level compared to standard diagnostic methods. This test could be implemented on-site as a single assay and a TAT of 12 hrs was consistently achieved (3).</p><p>Figure 1. Workflow for the simultaneous detection of bacteria, fungi and ARGs </p><p><img src='https://haystackanalytics.in/assets/blog/infexn-workflow.png'></img></p><p>Current methods used in clinical microbiology lack sensitivity and often rely on culture increasing TAT. Studies have already established an improved sensitivity and specificity of NGS compared with standard-of-care tests (4,5). Thus, a workflow for the direct-from-sample, on-site sequencing combined with automated genomics was demonstrated to be implementable, reproducible and feasible. Such an approach can be a viable option as the primary screening tool in clinical settings and promote a precision approach to antibiotic prescribing.</p><p><b>REFERENCES:</b><ol><li>Gu W, Miller S, Chiu CY.
