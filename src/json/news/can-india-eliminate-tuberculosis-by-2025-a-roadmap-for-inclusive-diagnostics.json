   "description": "In a large country like India with a population of more than 1.4 billion, access to quality healthcare continues to pose an enormous challenge for the masses. The paucity of  hospital beds, lack of paramedical staff,  broken supply chains, dearth of trained epidemiologists, and shortage of medical supplies during the Covid-19 crisis exposed our grossly inadequate public healthcare systems like never before. On the flip side, however, it also resulted in some breakthrough medical interventions. Under normal circumstances, vaccine development would usually take anywhere between 10-15 years, but India was swift to respond to the situation and scaled up its efforts by developing Covid vaccines in less than a year, highlighting the ability of our healthcare community to achieve impossible targets through integration and collaboration. While we found ourselves in dire straits due to the rampant spread of the novel coronavirus, the pandemic has derailed us from the path to fight many other diseases that could impair our healthcare systems, if not addressed in due time.",
