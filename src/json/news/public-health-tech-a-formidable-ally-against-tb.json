   "description": "Tuberculosis (TB) is one of Indiaâ€™s foremost public health problems. As per World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates, India has the highest burden of TB in the world. In 2021, the country witnessed a 19% upsurge in TB cases over the previous year. Despite having an aggressive TB control programme in place, drug resistance has led to the country witnessing a sharp increase in the number of cases over the last decade. By recent estimates, 75% of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) cases remain undiagnosed, with such patients actively transmitting the disease. Diagnosing DR-TB at an early stage is a major challenge, as it can take up to three months to detect it using existing approaches. This is where genome sequencing comes in, as it enables early and accurate diagnosis of such diseases and helps cut the costs of diagnosis and therapy.",
